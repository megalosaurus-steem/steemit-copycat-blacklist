# steemit-copycat-blacklist
A public blacklist of copycats (plagiarists, content thieves, spammers) on the Steemit platform.

I have created the account **[@megalosaurus](https://steemit.com/@megalosaurus)** on **Steemit** with the aim to **find, report, and flag accounts** which are part of a network of semi-professional **copycats**, including plagiarists and content spammers. I will use this GitHub repository to **publicly expose them**.

*[Steemit](https://steemit.com) is a platform to self-publish original content, which is by the community rewarded in the Steem crypto currencies. It is all about original content. Providing original content is what Steemias get paid for. This is the very core, the essence of how on this decentralized content publishing platform, profits are distributed, and contribution rewarded. By letting malice individuals, or whole groups, manipulate the system by rewarding copied content equally as high or even higher than original content, the whole Steemit economy is in jeopardy, the Steem currencies in immediate danger of devaluation by reward inflation, and thus every single genuine content creatorâ€™s Steemit income at stake.*

This GitHub repository is used to maintain a central public blacklist of identified copycats. Other Steemit users may use this list to actively engage these malicious accounts by commenting on, reporting, or flagging their abusive content.

## The blacklist
***Notes:***
* `*` marks posts which have been edited by the author to comply with Steemit original content rules after I have commented on them.
